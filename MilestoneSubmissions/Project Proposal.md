5. ### **Application Description[​](https://cuboulder-csci3308.pages.dev/docs/labs/lab9/#5-application-description):** 

   ### Our application will rate and rank local restaurants by their cost value and quality. We will use an API call to Google to obtain the restaurants in a specific location and use ratings from users to create a ranked list of these websites that will be displayed on the discover page. Users will also individually rank restaurants to determine the overall ranked list. Each user will have an individual page where they can add restaurants to their ranked lists. Finally, users can search by restaurant or cuisine.

   ### When individuals log in, they can go to their personal page or their discover page. The personal page will display a current ranked list of all the added restaurants from the user in their default location. In addition, they can add a description if they would like.  They will have the option to switch locations if they have ranked restaurants in other locations. They will have an option to add a restaurant, with which they will place the restaurant in their list based on their assessment of “bang-for-buck” in relation to the other restaurants.

   ### The discover page will display a list of all restaurants ranked by all other users in a location. To determine the overall ranking we will first  determine individual restaurant rankings by dividing a restaurant’s place on an individual’s list by the total number of restaurants on the list. We will add all of these values together and rank the restaurants by lowest to highest number. If the individual searches for a restaurant or cuisine, we will specifically display these restaurant(s).

6. ### **Vision Statement:** “To be the go-to platform for budget-conscious diners, where users can find and discover affordable, quality meals at local restaurants with ease.”

     
7. ### **Version Control:** updated github with all relevant files 
   

8. ### **Development Methodology:** Agile development with a kanban board on github projects. 

9. ### **Communication Plan:** Our team will use Discord as our primary platform for collaboration and communication, enabling us to coordinate tasks, share updates, and promptly address any issues that arise. Additionally, we will use GitHub comments on user story issues to keep communication organized and track our project development tasks. Weekly team meetings are scheduled for Mondays at 12:15 PM, with the flexibility to adjust to after the TA meeting if needed, based on team members' availability.


10. ### **Meeting Plan:** Our team has scheduled regular meetings on Mondays at 12:15 PM via group video chat on Discord to review progress, discuss upcoming tasks, and address any challenges. Additionally, we will meet with our TA every Wednesday at 1:30 PM via Zoom. This consistent schedule will help ensure alignment, maintain effective communication, and keep the project on track.
